Companies have large legacy code bases that are hard to migrate manually. The Amazing C/Cobol To JAva Transpiler is meant to explore one possible solution: automatic transpilation. Right now this project is work in progress, focusing on C and Cobol code bases that contain embedded SQL of some kind. It uses [ANTLR](http://www.antlr.org/) to do some of the heavy lifting.
